# III. Core Principles

We are introducing to ¨Aurum Design System¨ 

The name ¨Aurum¨, the Latin word for gold, symbolizes value, reliability, and trust, qualities that align closely with Monzo Bank’s mission of delivering exceptional financial services. 

The name evokes a sense of premium quality and refinement while remaining rooted in clarity and purpose.

The name also subtly reflects Monzo’s vibrant and modern brand while reinforcing its commitment to transparency and user empowerment.

 Just as gold serves as a standard of excellence, Aurum design system´s core principles are:

1. Clarity

2. Vibrant Experience

3. Inclusivity

4. Accessibility

## Clarity 

Why:

Clarity improves the quality of use. In digital banking, users need to absorb information and make decisions with speed and confidence. When interfaces are clear, trust increases and mistakes decrease.

How it translates into the system:

- Maintain a clean, logical visual hierarchy using consistent spacing, layout, and alignment.
- Prioritize legibility with accessible typography and strong contrast.
- Keep language plain and purposeful, no jargon or ambiguity.
- Ensure components communicate their purpose and state clearly (e.g., hover, active, disabled).

## Vibrant Experience 

Why:
 
Banking doesn’t have to feel cold or transactional. A vibrant interface brings energy, optimism, and user engagement, reinforcing Monzo’s personality.

How it translates into the system:

- Use Monzo’s bright color palette intentionally to guide focus and inspire confidence.
- Introduce micro-interactions and light animations to add delight.
- Personalize visuals where possible (e.g., pots, avatars, illustrations, custom categories).
- Maintain a balance between fun and function

## Inclusivity 

Why:

Financial tools must serve a wide range of users ,across abilities, backgrounds, and financial literacy levels. Inclusivity means everyone feels seen and supported.

How it translates into the system:

- Use inclusive language that’s respectful and easy to understand.
- Design for edge cases, not just ideal paths (e.g., debt, shared accounts, non-binary genders).
- Represent diversity in imagery, examples, and personas.
- Support localization, alternative input methods, and variable data formats.

## Accessibility 

Why:

Accessibility is a right, and a legal requirement in financial services. Everyone should be able to access, understand, and interact with their finances independently.

How it translates into the system:

- Follow WCAG 2.2 standards (minimum AA compliance).
- Ensure sufficient contrast ratios in all components.
- Provide keyboard, screen reader, and focus support for all interactive elements.
- Avoid relying solely on color to convey meaning (use text, icons, etc.).
