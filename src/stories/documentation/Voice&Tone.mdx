# IV. Voice & Tone

Monzo’s tone of voice is shaped by three core principles: Straightforward Kindness, Everyday Magic, and Warm Wit. 

Aurum carries these principles through every interface and interaction ,from navigation copy to system messages to ensure communication feels thoughtful, helpful, and uniquely Monzo.

## Straightforward Kindness

We’re clear, inclusive, focused on the reader, and go out of our way to make complex things simple.

- Focus on what matters to readers 
- Be welcoming to everyone 
- Swap formal words to normal words
- Watch out for jargons 
- Write in the active voice

## Everyday Magic

We add magical touches to our writing and elevate the mundane every day. That could mean a bold flourish, or a moment of delight where our customers least expect it. (It doesn’t mean using the ‘language’ of magic.)

We draw on universal experiences to connect with our audiences. And we pause to celebrate little wins or commiserate frustrating moments everyone experiences in their financial lives, without being patronising.

We look for ways to inject a little everyday magic throughout the customer experience, but mainly this belongs to our brand and marketing writing.

- Celebrate the little wins 
- Use vivid words & delightful wordplay
- Draw on relatable money moments 
- Contribute to big cultural moments & conversations
- Make references most people understand

## Warm Wit

We add humour to our writing like a delicate seasoning; we don’t want it to be overpowering or distract from the main message. This means we can be funny, rather than that we have to be funny,less is more.

This principle belongs almost exclusively in our brand and marketing writing, with the occasional surprise in the app.

- Add a pinch of humour, not a dollop
- Smart asides, not cheap puns and cliches
- Be self-assured, but never arrogant
- Contextual moments, not stereotypical tropes



# Illustrations Guidance

Illustration style is consistent, minimal, and emotionally engaging without being distracting.

Core Characteristics:

- Bold & Rounded Shapes: Use smooth curves and soft geometry to create friendly characters and objects.

- Flat with Subtle Depth: Mostly flat color fills with occasional light shading or simple shadows to add focus and lift.

- Vibrant Color Accents: Leverages Monzo’s signature palette with warm, saturated tones (e.g., coral, navy, teal).

- Minimal Detail: Keep facial features and props simple to maintain clarity at smaller sizes.

- Positive Emotion: Express cheerfulness, calm, or confidence ,avoiding anything overly goofy or dramatic.


Usage Guidance:
- Use illustrations in onboarding, empty states, success screens, and education moments.
- Keep compositions uncluttered — the illustration should support the message, not compete with it.
- Avoid realism or high-detail rendering that breaks from the system’s friendly tone.
- Maintain accessibility: Ensure illustrations do not replace essential content and meet contrast standards.
