# I. Brand Experience Audit

Our assessment of Monzo Bank‚Äôs brand experience highlights a strong alignment between their brand values and their digital product design. However, there are areas where design consistency could be further optimized across platforms and touchpoints.

Monzo‚Äôs tone of voice, visual styling, and interaction models are generally cohesive & energetic, especially across the mobile app. Still, slight inconsistencies in spacing, visual hierarchy, and the handling of illustrations or icons across web and app interfaces may dilute the overall brand coherence. 

These gaps present an opportunity for the Aurum design system to enhance and unify Monzo‚Äôs visual language, interaction patterns, and content guidelines,strengthening both internal design workflows and external brand perception.
